## Purpose
The purpose of this module was to create an interactive website for UFO enthusiasts that allows the reader to parse the data around UFO sightings. 
  
___

### Results
* The website contains several key items that are used as search criteria including: 
   * Date
   * City
   * State
   * Country
   * Shape 
   * Duration
   * Comments

* A user can input a value in any of the fields and if there are results matching the description, that will display in the table.  In the example below, a search was entered for    the city of El Cajon. Results show only those that were recorded in that city.

### Summary

* One drawback on this webpage is the inability to search for free text within the dataset or the page itself. 
* Recommendations for further development would be to include a larger data set.  This is a limited number of sightings.  The formatting of the data table is also not standard. 
  Data should not be abbreviated and there needs be a solid data structure and formatting to allow for optimal search results. Examples of this would be: 
  * Minutes should be spelled out rather than 'mins' or 'min'
  * State names should be spelled out rather than 'ca' or 'fl' for California or Florida
